Description: CLD2 probabilistically detects over 80 languages in Unicode UTF-8 text, either 
    plain text or HTML/XML. For mixed-language input, CLD2 returns the top three languages found
    and their approximate percentages of the total text bytes (e.g. 80% English and 20% French 
    out of 1000 bytes).
